# Sugarcane Production Data Science Project

This project aims to analyze and visualize the data of sugarcane production data using Python and popular data analysis libraries such as Pandas, Seaborn, and Matplotlib. The dataset used in this analysis is named "List of Countries by Sugarcane Production.csv." This analysis provides insights into sugarcane production across different countries and continents. It explores the relationship between various production-related metrics and uncovers patterns and trends within the dataset.

## Dataset

The dataset contains information about sugarcane production in various countries. It includes the following columns:

- `Country`: The name of the country.
- `Continent`: The continent where the country is located.
- `Production(Tons)`: Total sugarcane production in tons.
- `Production_per_person(Kg)`: Sugarcane production per person in kilograms.
- `Acreage(Hectare)`: Total acreage of land used for sugarcane cultivation in hectares.
- `Yield(Kg/Hectare)`: Yield of sugarcane in kilograms per hectare.
